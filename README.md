Arduino Flow Rider Car
The Arduino line-following car is a project that combines the principles of robotics, electronics, and programming to create a fun and educational toy. Using an Arduino microcontroller, sensors, and motors, the car is able to follow a black line on a white surface autonomously. 

The project is a great way to learn about sensors and how they can be used to detect and respond to different stimuli. By programming the Arduino to interpret the sensor data and control the motors accordingly, users can experiment with different algorithms and fine-tune the performance of the car.

The line-following car can be customized and expanded in a variety of ways, such as adding additional sensors for obstacle avoidance or Bluetooth connectivity for remote control. The possibilities for creativity and innovation are endless, making this project a perfect choice for hobbyists, students, and anyone interested in exploring the world of robotics.

This repository includes all the necessary code, schematics, and documentation to build your own Arduino line-following car. Whether you're a beginner looking to dip your toes into the world of robotics or an experienced maker seeking a new challenge, this project has something for everyone. Let's get started and see where your imagination takes you!
